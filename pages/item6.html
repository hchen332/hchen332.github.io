<h2>ABOUT THIS WEBPAGE</h2>
<p>
    This website was built from scratch with Node.js and Vite, and uses Three.js to render a 3D model.<br />
    The website layout is to emulate the appearance of an Action RPG invectory. Three.js is a Javascript 3D library that is often used to make browser games.
    For this website, it renders a 3D model I made and allows the user to rotate it, just like you would in your RPG inventory.<br />
    Much care was taken to ensure everything, model included, scales with the window size, feel free to test it out!<br />
    I used the official documentation for Three.js as my guide for implementing the model, their website is at <a href="https://threejs.org">threejs.org</a>.
