<h2>ABOUT THIS WEBPAGE</h2>
<p>This webpage was built from scratch using Three.js and Vite, and hosted on Github Pages.</p>
<p>Three.js is the JavaScript library used to render the 3D model you see on the left. It is interactable, go ahead and rotate it!</p>
<p>The model, its rigs, and its animations were made by myself as part of a different project. In order to render the model on this webpage, I followed the guide in the documentation for Three.js found on their site at <a href="https://threejs.org">threejs.org</a>.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge I encountered was properly building my project, Vite was not building the correct file paths for me. After many, many hours of scouring the internet, I finally found my <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/threejs/comments/z31v6w/gltf_files_not_found_in_production/">solution</a>. Storing my assets in an asset folder helped Vite identify the files it needed to bundle. Turns out, file structure is really important!</p>
