<h2>ABOUT THIS WEBPAGE</h2>
<p>This website was built from scratch with Node.js and Vite, and uses Three.js to render a 3D model.</p>
<p>The website layout is to mulate the appearance of an Action RPG invectory. Three.js is a Javascript 3D library that is often used to make browser games. For this website, it renders a 3D model I made and allows the user to rotate it, just like you might in an RPG!</p>
<p>I used the official documentation for Three.js as my guide for implementing the model, their website is at <a href="https://threejs.org">threejs.org</a>.</p>
