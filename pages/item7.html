<h2>BLENDER PROJECTS</h2>
<p>
    Game development is equal parts art and programming.
    I took up the challenge of learning to use Blender because I felt that understanding the process which art must go through to be placed into a game is integral to Game Development.
    Now, I have experience modeling, rigging, animating, and manipulating skeletons inside the engine.
</p>
<p>It just so happens that art is one of my hobbies!</p>

<p><b>FOX</b></p>
<p>A model I made for my Senior Project game. He has  4 animations for each cardinal direction of movement which, using a blend tree in Unity, resulted in the appearance of 8-directional movement animations.</p>

<p><b>DRAGON</b></p>
<p>A quick, low-poly model I made of my D&D character, a Pact of the Dragon Warlock. After working hard to make 4 animations for my Fox model, I decided to reduce my work by only making a forward and backward moving animation and sort out 8-directional movement in code instead.</p>

<p><b>DRUID-NECROMANCER</b></p>
<p>My first Blender model where I hand painted the textures and worked in many fine details. She is my concept for a druid-necromancer who's fighting moves involve spirits of deceased animals.</p>
