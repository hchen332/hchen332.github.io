<h2>UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, RIVERSIDE&nbsp;&nbsp;<p1>2019 - 2023</p1></h2>
<p>I am a recent <b>Computer Science</b> graduate from UC Riverside.</p>
<p>
    During the course of my academic career, I've developed my programming skills and internalized fundamental principles of engineering and problem solving.
    To me, programming is more than just solving problems efficiently, it's creating lasting structures that can be built upon and improved by yourself and others.
</p>
<p>I use principles of code reusability, design patterns, and modularity in all of my work and I hope to apply my knowledge in the field of <b>Game Development</b>.</p>
