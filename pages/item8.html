<h2>UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, RIVERSIDE&nbsp;&nbsp;<p1>2019 - 2023</p1></h2>
<p>I am a recent <b>Computer Science</b> graduate from UC Riverside.</p>
<p>
    During the course of my academic career, I've developed my programming skills and internalized fundamental principles of engineering and problem solving.
    My time in university evolved my perspective on Computer Science from a field about programming to an applied science scaffolded by methods developed over the course of decades.
</p>
<p>I use principles like design patterns, version control, and modularity in all of my work and I hope to apply my knowledge in the field of <b>Game Development</b>.</p>
