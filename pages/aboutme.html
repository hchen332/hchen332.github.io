<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
<p><b>Greetings!</b></p>
<p>My name is <b>Coco</b>, I'm an aspiring <b>Game Developer</b> with a passion for video games.</p>
<p>I have always loved games, and I have always engaged with my interests by creating. I consider myself an engineer and an artist who approaches every problem by seeking out efficient and creative solutions.</p>
<p>I am always taking on the challenge of learning new tools and skills. Check out some of my projects (including this webpage) by navigating the icons!</p>

<p>When I'm not making games, I'm playing them! Here are some of my favorites:</p>
<li>Elden Ring</li>
<li>Assassin's Creed Odyssey</li>
<li>Civilization VI</li>
<li>The Binding of Isaac</li>
<li>Slay the Spire</li>
